This PRD outlines the requirements for a web-based application that allows users to register, log in, upload audio or video files, process them for viruses, transcribe audio to text, and handle encryption for sensitive data (PII/PCI). It accompanies the provided code implementation, ensuring alignment between requirements and technical solution.

## 2. Introduction
### 2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for uploading multimedia files (audio/video), automatically transcribing them into text, and storing both the original and transcribed files in cloud storage. The app includes virus scanning for security and conditional encryption to protect personally identifiable information (PII) or payment card industry (PCI) data. This ensures compliance with basic data protection principles while enabling efficient content processing.

### 2.2 Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - User authentication (registration and login via email/password).
  - File upload with prompts for PII/PCI presence.
  - Virus scanning, storage in Akamai Linode Object Storage.
  - Audio transcription to text.
  - File movement between storage folders (upload → processed).
  - Encryption of files containing PII/PCI.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Advanced user management (e.g., roles, password recovery).
  - Real-time transcription or multi-language support (unless extended via API).
  - Mobile app integration.
  - Full compliance certification (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA; requires external audit).
  - Payment processing or monetization features.

### 2.3 Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumptions**:
  - Users have access to modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
  - Files are primarily audio/video formats (e.g., MP3, MP4, WAV); unsupported formats will be rejected.
  - Internet connectivity is stable for uploads and API calls.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Third-party services: Akamai Linode Object Storage (S3-compatible), AssemblyAI (or similar) for transcription, ClamAV for virus scanning.
  - Environment: Node.js runtime, MongoDB for database, React.js for frontend.
  - API keys and credentials must be securely managed via environment variables.

## 3. Business Objectives
- Provide a secure platform for content creators, journalists, or businesses to transcribe media files without manual effort.
- Ensure data privacy by encrypting sensitive files, reducing risk of breaches.
- Minimize operational costs through cloud storage and automated processing.
- Achieve high user satisfaction with intuitive UI and reliable processing (target: <5% failure rate on uploads).
- Scalability: Handle up to 100 concurrent users initially, with potential for growth via cloud scaling.

## 4. User Personas
### 4.1 Primary Persona: Content Creator
- **Demographics**: 25-45 years old, tech-savvy, works in media/podcasting.
- **Goals**: Quickly upload interviews or recordings, get accurate transcriptions, ensure sensitive info (e.g., names, credit details) is protected.
- **Pain Points**: Manual transcription is time-consuming; concerns over data security in free tools.
- **Usage Scenario**: Uploads a podcast episode, flags PII, receives encrypted transcript.

### 4.2 Secondary Persona: Business Analyst
- **Demographics**: 30-50 years old, corporate professional.
- **Goals**: Process meeting recordings for compliance, store securely.
- **Pain Points**: Need for audit trails and encryption for PCI data.
- **Usage Scenario**: Uploads video call, confirms PCI presence, views processed files.

## 5. Functional Requirements
### 5.1 User Authentication
- **REQ-1.1**: Users shall register with a unique email and password (min. 8 characters, hashed with bcrypt).
- **REQ-1.2**: Users shall log in with email/password, receiving a JWT token for session management (expires in 1 hour).
- **REQ-1.3**: Protected routes (e.g., upload) require valid JWT; unauthorized access returns 401 error.

### 5.2 File Upload Interface
- **REQ-2.1**: Logged-in users access an upload form accepting audio/video files (max size: 500MB, formats: MP3, MP4, WAV, etc.).
- **REQ-2.2**: Form includes checkboxes: "Contains PII?" and "Contains PCI?" (boolean flags).
- **REQ-2.3**: On submit, display progress indicator and success/error messages.

### 5.3 File Processing Pipeline
- **REQ-3.1**: Scan uploaded file for viruses using ClamAV; reject if infected (delete temp file, notify user).
- **REQ-3.2**: Store scanned file in Linode bucket under "upload/" prefix.
- **REQ-3.3**: If PII/PCI flagged, encrypt file using AES-256 (crypto module); store keys securely (e.g., per-user in DB).
- **REQ-3.4**: Transcribe audio using AssemblyAI API; save text as .txt in "completed/" prefix (encrypt if flagged).
- **REQ-3.5**: Move original file to "processed/" prefix (copy then delete from "upload/").
- **REQ-3.6**: Handle errors (e.g., API failures) with retries (up to 3) and user notifications.

### 5.4 Data Storage and Retrieval
- **REQ-4.1**: Use MongoDB to store user metadata and file records (e.g., file ID, status, encryption flag).
- **REQ-4.2**: Optional: Dashboard to list user's processed files with download links (decrypt on-the-fly if needed).

### 5.5 User Flows / Use Cases
- **Use Case 1: Standard Upload**
  1. User logs in.
  2. Selects file, unchecks PII/PCI.
  3. Uploads; system scans, stores in upload/, transcribes, saves text in completed/, moves to processed/.
  4. User receives confirmation.
- **Use Case 2: Sensitive Upload**
  1. Similar to above, but checks PII/PCI.
  2. System encrypts file and text before storage.
- **Edge Case**: File > max size → Reject with error message.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
### 6.1 Performance
- Upload processing time: <2 minutes for 100MB file (assuming API latency).
- System uptime: 99% (handled by cloud hosting).
- Scalability: Auto-scale backend instances on Linode.

### 6.2 Security
- All data in transit via HTTPS.
- Passwords hashed; tokens secured.
- Encryption for PII/PCI: AES-256 with unique keys.
- Compliance: Basic alignment with data protection laws; recommend audit for production.

### 6.3 Usability
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly).
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).
- Error messages clear and actionable.

### 6.4 Reliability
- Backup storage daily.
- Logging for all actions (e.g., via Winston).

## 7. Technical Specifications
Aligns with provided code:
- **Frontend**: React.js with Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js, Multer for uploads, JWT for auth, Mongoose for MongoDB.
- **Integrations**: AWS SDK for Linode (S3-compatible), ClamAV daemon, AssemblyAI SDK.
- **Deployment**: Linode VM/Kubernetes, Nginx reverse proxy, Docker for containers.

## 8. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: API rate limits (e.g., AssemblyAI) → Mitigation: Implement queuing (BullMQ) and user notifications.
- **Risk**: Key management for encryption → Mitigation: Use AWS KMS or similar in production.
- **Risk**: High storage costs → Mitigation: Set retention policies (e.g., delete after 30 days).
- **Risk**: Virus false positives → Mitigation: Allow user appeals or secondary scanning.

## 9. Timeline and Milestones (High-Level)
- **Phase 1: Planning** (1 week): Finalize PRD, setup repo.
- **Phase 2: Development** (4-6 weeks): Implement auth, upload, processing (per code).
- **Phase 3: Testing** (2 weeks): Unit/integration tests, security scans.
- **Phase 4: Deployment** (1 week): Go-live on Linode.
- **Total Estimated Time**: 8-10 weeks for MVP.

## 10. Appendices
- **Glossary**:
  - PII: Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., names, emails).
  - PCI: Payment Card Industry data (e.g., credit card numbers).
- **References**: Provided code snippets; AssemblyAI docs; Linode Object Storage guide.

This PRD serves as a living document and should be updated as the project evolves. If additional features or changes are needed, revise accordingly.
