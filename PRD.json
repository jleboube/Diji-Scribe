    "title": "Product Requirements Document for Secure Audio/Video Upload and Transcription Web Application",
    "version": "1.0",
    "date": "2025-09-12",
    "author": "Grok 4 (xAI Assistant)",
    "stakeholders": ["Development Team", "Product Owner (User)", "Potential End-Users"],
    "approval_status": "Draft (Pending Review)",
    "description": "This PRD outlines the requirements for a web-based application that allows users to register, log in, upload audio or video files, process them for viruses, transcribe audio to text, and handle encryption for sensitive data (PII/PCI). It accompanies the provided code implementation, ensuring alignment between requirements and technical solution."
  },
  "introduction": {
    "purpose": "The purpose of this application is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for uploading multimedia files (audio/video), automatically transcribing them into text, and storing both the original and transcribed files in cloud storage. The app includes virus scanning for security and conditional encryption to protect personally identifiable information (PII) or payment card industry (PCI) data. This ensures compliance with basic data protection principles while enabling efficient content processing.",
    "scope": {
      "in_scope": [
        "User authentication (registration and login via email/password).",
        "File upload with prompts for PII/PCI presence.",
        "Virus scanning, storage in Akamai Linode Object Storage.",
        "Audio transcription to text.",
        "File movement between storage folders (upload → processed).",
        "Encryption of files containing PII/PCI."
      ],
      "out_of_scope": [
        "Advanced user management (e.g., roles, password recovery).",
        "Real-time transcription or multi-language support (unless extended via API).",
        "Mobile app integration.",
        "Full compliance certification (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA; requires external audit).",
        "Payment processing or monetization features."
      ]
    },
    "assumptions_and_dependencies": {
      "assumptions": [
        "Users have access to modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).",
        "Files are primarily audio/video formats (e.g., MP3, MP4, WAV); unsupported formats will be rejected.",
        "Internet connectivity is stable for uploads and API calls."
      ],
      "dependencies": [
        "Third-party services: Akamai Linode Object Storage (S3-compatible), AssemblyAI (or similar) for transcription, ClamAV for virus scanning.",
        "Environment: Node.js runtime, MongoDB for database, React.js for frontend.",
        "API keys and credentials must be securely managed via environment variables."
      ]
    }
  },
  "business_objectives": [
    "Provide a secure platform for content creators, journalists, or businesses to transcribe media files without manual effort.",
    "Ensure data privacy by encrypting sensitive files, reducing risk of breaches.",
    "Minimize operational costs through cloud storage and automated processing.",
    "Achieve high user satisfaction with intuitive UI and reliable processing (target: <5% failure rate on uploads).",
    "Scalability: Handle up to 100 concurrent users initially, with potential for growth via cloud scaling."
